A data visualization tool for Magic: the Gathering utilizing Chart.Js

Hello! This is a passion project of mine to visualize card data in Magic: the Gathering. If you're unfamiliar with the game it may be difficult to understand the data, so hopefully the explanation below will clear things up.

## Magic: the Gathering Basic Background Information
- Magic is a game with resources you can spend. Each card has a cost using this resource. For this project it is only important to know that most cards cost between 0 and 7
- One type of card is a creature. They have integer attack and defense numbers known as Power and Toughness
- Cards can either be one of five colors, a mix of colors, or no color at all. Different colored cards require different resources to play

## Purpose of This Project
My hope is that eventually these visualizations will be useful to high-level, entrenched players. The information provided can be useful for evaluating the relative strength of cards and colors for each expansion that comes out for the game. For example, some cards deal damage. Damage dealt can destroy creature cards if the damage is at least as much as their toughness. By visualizing the average or median toughness you can make statements like "3 damage is enough to destroy most creatures". 

## Future Plans
- Introduce many more visualizations
- Analyze card types other than creatures
- Introduce machine learning as a tool to provide insight on expansions ahead of their release

## Contributions
If you are a programmer, a fan of Magic, and/or interested in contributing to this project feel free to contact me. I will find something for you to help with or you can come up with features you'd like to add yourself
